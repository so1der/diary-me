<h1><b>Diary Me</b></h1>

So this is a test diary-app I wrote to practice with SQLite3 and to handle my old diary. It create SQLite3 database which contains 1 table - diary with 2 columns - date and page. Its important to understand that it dont have ID column, so 'date' must be unique for each row. 
I was going to continue development of this app, but then realize that its pointless. Despire that, you still can use this app, although I'm sure there are many better alternatives.
